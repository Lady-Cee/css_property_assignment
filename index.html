      <h3>Technology and I</h3>
      <p>My name is Cynthia Enweonwu-Arinze. I applied for scholarship with Ingrssive for good (I4G) and presently, 
        I am studying Software Engineering under the scholarship. 

        My love for technolgy stems from the fact that Technology helps me organize my life and work better,
        allows me to access information the moment I need it. If you think about what the future might hold and
        whatever your thought might be, it will involve technology in one way or another. <p>

        Technology is ever-changing. There’s never a dull moment! The developments since I got into the industry are 
        astonishing. Who would have thought that you can hold a mobile phone and contact anybody from around the world. 
        
        Connecting and making new friends. I get to meet like minded individuals through social media. Even as we are studying now, 
        I have made many friends. Moreover, it was due to technology that i was able to access and enfol for this
        scholarship which has been one of the greatest opportunity in my life.    <p>
        
        In addressing huge challenge, Technology  is a great career for problem solvers and dreamers alike and when they team up, 
        the magic happens! The feeling of working towards a solution that forges a new path, or of unravelling a 
        problem that has drawn upon our combined knowledge and expertise is tremendously satisfying. And I beleive
        this is one of the things we will achieve on this scholarship: Teamwork. <p>
        
        Technology facilitates Continuous learning. Technology allows me to learn always as it involves a whole lot of reasearch and team work
        to be an expert on technology

            <h3>My Learning so far and the importance of CSS</h3>
            <p>
            On the course of learning here, I can boast of knowledge, application and use of Git.
            I had a little knowledge of HTML and CSS but now I understand HTML more. CSS used to be very confusing 
            and frustrating for me but now, I understand how it works.
            I also learnt the importance of teamwork and peer to peer learning.  <p>

            On the importance of CSS, let's understand that CSS means Cascading Style Sheets.
            CSS is one of the three main cornerstones of technologies for the web.
            CSS is a design language that makes a website look more appealing than just plain or uninspiring pieces of text.
            CSS determines visual structure, layout, and aesthetics.
            CSS makes the front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience. 
            Without CSS, websites would be less pleasing to the eye and likely much harder to navigate.
             In addition to layout and format, CSS is responsible for font color and more. <p>
             CSS is important because it controls all design-related aspects of your website. 
             Typography, colours, page layouts and any other visual aspects of your website are all controlled by CSS.
             <p> <b>
                Other importance of CSS includes the following:</b>
                <ol class="listitem">
                    <li>Faster Page Speed. More code means slower page speed. And CSS enables you to use less code. 
                        CSS allows you to use one CSS rule and apply it to all occurrences of a certain tag within an HTML document.</li>
               <li>
                 Better User Experience. CSS not only makes web pages easy on the eye, it also allows for user-friendly
              formatting. When buttons and text are in logical places and well organized, user experience improves.
            
            </li>
            <li>
            
            Quicker Development Time. With CSS, you can apply specific formatting rules and styles to multiple pages
               with one string of code. One cascading style sheet can be replicated across several website pages. 
               If, for instance, you have product pages that should all have the same formatting, look, and feel, 
               writing CSS rules for one page will suffice for all pages of that same type.
            </li>
             
            <li>   
            Easy Formatting Changes. If you need to change the format of a specific set of pages,
                it’s easy to do so with CSS. There’s no need to fix every individual page. 
                Just edit the corresponding CSS stylesheet and you’ll see changes applied to all the pages that
                 are using that style sheet. 
                </li>

                <li> 
                Compatibility Across Devices. Responsive web design matters. In today’s day and age, web pages
                  must be fully visible and easily navigable on all devices. Whether mobile or tablet, desktop, 
                  or even smart TV, CSS combines with HTML to make responsive design possible.

               <p class="para"> Paddings </p>
                <div class="para1">
                Padding is the inner space between the content and the border of your box. 
                Padding can be set to zero pixels and above. It can change its own
                 element's size and impact how much of a fill color or background image is visible within a box. 
                 The CSS padding properties are used to generate space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.

            With CSS, you have full control over the padding. There are properties for setting the padding for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left). Negative values are not allowed.

       
            
        </div>




               <p class="para"> Borders</p>
                
               <div class="para1">
                Border is the perimeter of the box. Borders can be invisible or they could be a thick colored line,
                
                 The CSS border properties allow you to specify the style, width, and color of an element's border.
                 The border shorthand CSS property sets an element's border.
                  It sets the values of border-width, border-style, and border-color. 
                </div>

              <p class="para">  Margins </p>

              <div class="para1">
                Margin is the outer space (or lack of space) surrounding the box. It is the space outside the border Margins are essentially invisible barriers around a box. 
                They define how an element interacts with adjacent elements or the edge of a screen.
                 Margins can be set to zero and above and can also be set to auto and can even have negative values.
                 The CSS margin properties are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.
                 With CSS, you have full control over the margins. There are properties for setting the margin for each 
                 side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left). 
                 If the margin property has four values:

                 margin: 25px 50px 75px 100px; This means that the 
                 top margin is 25px, the right margin is 50px, 
                 the bottom margin is 75px and the 
                 left margin is 100px.
                </div>
